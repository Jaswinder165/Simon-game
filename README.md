ðŸ”¹ Simon Game 
The Simon Game is a classic memory game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of the game is to test and improve the playerâ€™s memory by having them repeat an ever-increasing sequence of colors and sounds.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used:
HTML: Creates the structure of the game including color buttons and game text.

CSS: Styles the game visually, giving it a colorful and interactive design.

JavaScript: Implements the game logic such as pattern generation, user input handling, game progression, and sound playback.

ðŸŽ® How the Game Works:
The game displays a sequence of button flashes and corresponding sounds.

The player must repeat the sequence in the correct order.

If the player succeeds, a new color is added to the sequence.

If the player fails, the game ends and prompts them to restart.

Sound effects for each color

Strict sequence-matching logic

Responsive keyboard or click-based controls

Level tracking and game restart functionality
